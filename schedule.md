#### Bonus Primary Source Reading

For some reason, the translation of Irenaeus by Grant has left out the following key passage in Book III, Chapter 5, Section 1. When you get to page 96, please add this in just before the section marked "5.1". (*Hint*: You may want to include this in your florilegium).

"III.5.1. Since, therefore, the tradition from the apostles does thus exist in the Church, and is permanent among us, let us revert to the Scriptural proof furnished by those apostles who did also write the Gospel, in which they recorded the doctrine regarding God, pointing out that our Lord Jesus Christ is the truth, and that no lie is in Him. As also David says, prophesying His birth from a virgin, and the resurrection from the dead, “Truth has sprung out of the earth.” The apostles, likewise, being disciples of the truth, are above all falsehood; for a lie has no fellowship with the truth, just as darkness has none with light, but the presence of the one shuts out that of the other. Our Lord, therefore, being the truth, did not speak lies; and whom He knew to have taken origin from a defect, He never would have acknowledged as God, even the God of all, the Supreme King, too, and His own Father, an imperfect being as a perfect one, an animal one as a spiritual, Him who was without the Pleroma as Him who was within it. Neither did His disciples make mention of any other God, or term any other Lord, except Him, who was truly the God and Lord of all..."

Please only answer one!

1. Why does the author of the "Secret Book of John" think that their reader will be interested in the revelation contained in the book? How does reading the book help save the reader?
2. What is truth according to Irenaeus? What are some of the rules of faith by which he argues that Christians can determine if a teacher or "scripture" conforms to the truth?
3. How do the authors of the "Acts of Thecla" and "The Passion of Saints Perpetua and Felicity" portray the Christian faith as offering an alternative to the gender norms of Roman Society? (Hint: How do the authors employ "paradoxical antitheses"? You may also wish to explore the limits of this rhetorical method.)
