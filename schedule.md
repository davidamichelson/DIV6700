Questions for *Florilegium II* are:

1. Early Christian authors often drew upon the rhetorical strategy of creating "paradoxical antitheses" in which they re-defined or re-valued the norms of society through a Christian lens. How did early Christian authors used such paradoxes to express their theology of martyrdom?

2. How do the authors of the "Acts of Thecla" and "The Passion of Saints Perpetua and Felicity" portray the Christian faith as offering an alternative to the gender norms of Roman Society? (Hint: How do the authors employ "paradoxical antitheses"? You may also wish to explore the limits of this rhetorical method.)

##### Extension options:

1. Standard Option: Turn in your florilegium by 9 PM Tuesday, your TA will grade it before section meets on Thursday.

2. Delayed No-Penalty Option: Turn in your florilegium anytime BEFORE your section on Thursday. You will not have a late penalty, but your TA will also not be able to grade it until after section. (This option is for the week of Sept. 10 only).

3. Late Penalty Option: Turn in your florilegium after the start of your section on Thursday. The standard one letter grade late penalty will still apply (as per the syllabus) but we will still be happy to grade your work and give constructive feedback.

#### Bonus Primary Source Reading

For some reason, the translation of Irenaeus by Grant has left out the following key passage in Book III, Chapter 5, Section 1. When you get to page 96, please add this in just before the section marked "5.1". (*Hint*: You may want to include this in your florilegium).

"III.5.1. Since, therefore, the tradition from the apostles does thus exist in the Church, and is permanent among us, let us revert to the Scriptural proof furnished by those apostles who did also write the Gospel, in which they recorded the doctrine regarding God, pointing out that our Lord Jesus Christ is the truth, and that no lie is in Him. As also David says, prophesying His birth from a virgin, and the resurrection from the dead, “Truth has sprung out of the earth.” The apostles, likewise, being disciples of the truth, are above all falsehood; for a lie has no fellowship with the truth, just as darkness has none with light, but the presence of the one shuts out that of the other. Our Lord, therefore, being the truth, did not speak lies; and whom He knew to have taken origin from a defect, He never would have acknowledged as God, even the God of all, the Supreme King, too, and His own Father, an imperfect being as a perfect one, an animal one as a spiritual, Him who was without the Pleroma as Him who was within it. Neither did His disciples make mention of any other God, or term any other Lord, except Him, who was truly the God and Lord of all..."

Question for *Practice Exam* is:

How did Christians view the Roman Empire in the first four centuries of Christianity? Please describe three different Christian views of the Roman Empire using three of the early Christian primary sources assigned for our course. At least one source must have been written after the conversion of Constantine in the 4th century C.E. For each source, use quotations and citations to illustrate how the Christian author viewed Roman imperial power. Please formulate a thesis which answers the main question. 

Example thesis: The attitudes of early Christians toward Roman political power developed and changed over time. At first Christians viewed the persecuting power of the Empire as a form of evil to be resisted. After the conversion of Constantine, Eusebius of Caesarea praised the power of the Emperor as providential, but a later theologian, Augustine, offered a more nuanced view of the sort of peace that empire could bring.

For the purposes of this practice exam, you may use your books, notes, and your past florilegia and commentarius. You may reuse any writing you already have written for our class as part of your answer. The final exam will be timed, so for the purpose of our practice exam, set a 60 minute period for yourself during which you work from your notes and previous florilegia to put together an answer. Your answer should be typed and should not be more than 1000 words.

Nota bene: There is no florilegium due this week, *but*, you will need to read the texts for this week and take notes to answer this question.

#### Assignments
- *Midterm Paper Draft Introduction* Due by 9:00 PM on 10/6.

The midterm paper (1,000 words in length) is due on 10/15. For 10/6 please prepare a draft introduction of 150-200 words. This draft will be reviewed by your TA but is not factored into your final grade so please use it to test your ideas. The question to be addressed in the draft is: "According to the ancient editor of the *Apophthegmata Patrum*, what is the goal of the monastic life? How does the ancient editor employ the rhetoric of paradox to make this point? Analyze one or more of the organizational themes used by the editor to support your interpretation."

The introduction of the paper should both introduce your answer to the question and let the reader know any relevant historical background in order to follow your argument. Do not spend too much time summarizing historical details, but do give your reader the basic essentials of who wrote the texts, when, and why. You will need to get this information from the textbooks and lectures in class. Finish by stating your answer to the question (your “thesis”) as clearly and briefly as possible at the end of your introduction. 

You may also use secondary sources (such as the chapter from Harmless) to help you in your work but reading beyond works listed in the syllabus is not necessary. Stick to the text; work at what the ancient editor is trying to say in collecting these sayings and why he or she is saying it. This is not the place for you to express your own judgments on whether you love or hate the *Apophthegmata Patrum*. We are interested in understanding how the ancient Christians viewed their own religious experience.

Please do consider meeting with the Divinity School writing tutor to help you proofread. While you are encouraged to ask a friend to check your grammar and prose; students are not allowed to co-author this assignment. The ideas must be your own.
